It’s time to get down and give our take on the pretty controversial news that Mel shared with everyone on The Pinball Show #3.

In Zen’s _The Pinball Show Ep. 3_, Mel Kirk sat down with Bobby and they talked more about Pinball FX, including some hard questions that they knew they’d need to tackle eventually.

The biggest news is that the Pinball FX platform is going to be an Epic Game Store exclusive for one year, and you will need to re-buy all your tables.

It’s worth breaking down some of the points that Mel raised and extrapolate upon them because you might have missed some of the contexts due to information overload.
