:experimental:

What would you put into a pinball machine if you could design your own from the ground up?
Chris and Jared debate over a list of things you normally find in pinball machines and build out their dream tables. 

Should a table have flow, or will it be stop-and-go?
Should you have drop targets everywhere or stand-up targets for sharpshooters to take aim at?

Perhaps you'll join in and give your grail pinball fit-out in the comments?
We'd love to hear what you reckon would make your table "just right" for you!

We touch briefly on the news about The Princess Bride and Goat Simulator releases coming later in August, but expect more detailed coverage about that after we get to play with the tables.

== Show notes

The show notes are the main reason why audio episodes are delayed. 
They take as long as the show takes to record to produce because to do it right (not with ChatGPT summaries) I have to listen back through the show and summarize them.

If you're missing the show notes and care enough about them, send this message to our BlahCade Twitter account or to blahblahblahcade@gmail.com:

`I missed the BlahCade show note summaries in Episode 277 and Jared told me to send this message.`

I'm doing a test to see how many people even read the notes from our show, and you sending this message is the only way I can truly work that out.
