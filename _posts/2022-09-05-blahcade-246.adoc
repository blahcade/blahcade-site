:experimental:

We speculate a bit about what is coming up from Zen in Pinball FX for September, October, and November. 

We then dive into the live play of Zen's latest, _Homeworld: Journey to Higara Pinball_. 
Is this Zen Original a "buy now" or "don't bother"?

== Show notes

=== 00:30 - National Cinema Day

Chris shares his experience of seeing _Jaws_ in 3D during the US _National Cinema Day_.
Even though he knew it was coming, he still got the jump scare in the movie.

We also talked a bit about watching 3D movies in VR and that I never actually did it.

Chris also planned to see _1000 Years of Longing_ and _Bullet Train_ so maybe he can give us his thoughts about those two next week.

=== 15:00 - Pinball Show Recap

Mel Kirk revealed that future versions of the Pinball Show will be shorter-length episodes and only focus on the table being released that month.
There will be some light developer interviews in these episodes to back up the table release.

The episodes will be a bit longer for bigger announcements to suit the amount of news. 
Expect this format when they announce console support, for example.

=== 18:00 - The new  Pinball FX roadmap for the rest of 2022

Also, in the pinball show, the popular roadmap released at the beginning of the Early Access program on Epic Games was updated with new information.

September:: Big remaster pack and a surprise (we're guessing Marvel and something else).

October:: A Williams title.

November:: Zen original and remaster pack (we're guessing all the remaining Zen Original tables).

This news sparked great speculation about what the packs could contain on our https://discord.gg/c6HmDcQhpq[BlahCade Discord Server].

=== 44:31 - Let's Play Homeworld Pinball

Chris does the flipping, and I do most of the yapping as we do a _Let's Play_ of Zen Studio's new table _Homeworld: Journey to Higara Pinball_.

NOTE: I've left the game audio in, but you should use it as your cue to watch the gameplay on YouTube if you are a podcast listener.
Get the YouTube link from the top of these show notes.

Here are some screenshots from the game.
