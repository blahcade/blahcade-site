== Show notes

=== Pre-show banter

We talk about Jared moving house, Banning Museum of Pinball going into liquidation, the price of Arcade 1Up pinball cabinets going up, and how even IKEA is getting stung with lumber costs. 

Feels good to just shoot the breeze with y'all again.

=== 18:00 - Zen Pinball Party announcement on Apple Arcade

Zen Pinball Party is a collection of 12 tables, including hot-seat play.

The title seems to be aiming at the all-ages market, which is indicated by the titles and themes. 

Dreamworks licensed tables include _Dragons_, _Kung Fu Panda_, and _Trolls_.

There are four original Zen tables (which we reckon will cycle) and four Williams Pinball titles.

Here are some screenshots to whet your appetite.

Follow along at home with us as we tease screen grabs from the video trailer apart before the official release next episode.

Will our gameplay predictions play out for these tables?

=== 42:00 - Let's address the exclusivity question

Right now, this title is only on Apple Arcade. 
You can bet there is money on the table here to keep this product exclusive to Apple's ecosystem for a pre-determined amount of time.

Is this a terrible thing?
Will these tables be available in the core Pinball FX tables?
Who knows at this stage, but we both think they will be available at some point.

If you're in the US, check out the deal through the Target app for six months of free Apple Arcade if you have an issue with the exclusivity period.

=== 51:00 - What are some other IPs from DreamWorks

Will we see Shrek? Will we see MegaMind? 

The possibilities really are endless. 

Then we have Hasbro? Transformers? Heck yeah! G.I. Joe? Maybe not, but who knows, right? 

=== 56:00 - Noir table details

We can see an update on Noir in the latest episode of The Pinball show.

There seem to be more rendered playfield models and what looks like a ball staging mechanism where the twisty ramp was in the early design reveal. 
This could be a very large multiball feature. 

How good would it be if we saw some fog floating across the table to mask the ball's movement?
There are plenty of possibilities here, but there need to be some variations in the insert lighting.

We only got three actual seconds of gameplay in this tease, so there is clearly more to be done.
