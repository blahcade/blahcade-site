Zen Studios has lent us some time to chat about Williams Pinball and other Zen questions.

Akos, Thomas and Mel take time out of their work evening to chat with us about how Zen goes about engineering their tables, and the experience that goes along with designing the premiere mobile pinball experience.

It‚Äôs a short but oh so sweet interview and will fill the gap you have between the slightly longer episodal gap we‚Äôve been having of late.
Enjoy, and let us know what you reckon.
