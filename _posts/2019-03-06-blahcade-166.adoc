Zen Studios have joined the show to announce what will be in the Williams Pinball Volume 3 release coming out very soon.

Now that the Williams Pinball Vol 1 and Vol 2 Beta has run its course on iOS and Android, it’s time for Zen to talk about the latest Williams Pinball DLC drop across all platforms.

Hear Mel Kirk and Thomas Crofts (apologies from Akos Györkei who had to bail early to get Zen’s Twitch stream set up) lay down what we can expect from Volume 3.

For those forensic fans out there, one of the tables will not be a surprise. 
But there may be a couple of tables in Volume 3 that have come out of left field.

There’s also some (now somewhat old, but nonetheless) awkward and uncomfortable news about Magic Pixel’s Zaccaria Pinball app on Android at the end of the show.
