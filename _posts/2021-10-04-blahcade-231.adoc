Back with another episode that this time feautures gameplay of Zen's newest Pinball Party title, Peanuts. 

Plus we take a look at Skillshot FX's new virtual pinball cabinet. 

And then there's the big question mark over Zen interviewing Spooky Pinball! 
Does this mean we'll be seeing digital versions of their tables in Pinball FX?

== Show notes

=== 10:00 - Skillshot FX and Zen Studios partnership

Arcade 1UP has now had their product on the market now for over a year, but there is a new partnership to talk about.

Zen Studios partnered with a company called Skillshot FX to offer a premium digital pinball cabinet including tables from FX3.

https://skillshotfx.com/

This is a steam-based system which lets you connect your library to this cabinet, and the lockdown bar has a control interface suited specifically for key interface options in FX3 (such as camera and pause).

The product features a 52" monitor with a live backglass monitor (size not disclosed yet).
The backglasses are supplied with the table, meaning that you don't need to track them down yourself. 
There is no manual plunger, and buttons for nudge. 
Why Skillshot FX didn't work out a way to use the lockdown bar as a tilt interface boggles both our minds.

All this for $9000. "Wait, what?" you might be yelling at the screen. Yep that's a steep price point for the features offered in this package.

=== 27:00 - Snoopy Pinball playthrough.

We play through the brand new _Zen Pinball Party_ table: Snoopy Pinball.

Jump over to the video link at about the jump time in the heading and check out the playthrough.

Overall we both quite like the table and think the game is probably the best Animated Heroes table released to date. 
The callouts actually tell you where you need to shoot, and the gameplay is quite peaceful in nature. 
The art style is fantastic, although there are some obstructing features like the Kite-eating Tree that obscure rollover.

=== 41:40 - What do Jared's kids think of Zen Pinball Party

I gave the iPad over to Zach and Sienna to try out the latest Snoopy table, and the feedback about the game surprised me.

Their feedback backs up the vision that Zen has for Zen Pinball Party, and the overall ecosystem of Pinball FX.

=== 45:00 - Dolby interview Spooky Pinball

Last episode Chris and I were talking about how it would make sense for Zen to pair up with boutique pinball manufacturers like Spooky Pinball and American Pinball.

This month we get a full 30-minute interview with Dolby from Zen and Spooky Pinball. 
The really interesting part in this interview was right at the end where the discussion turned to Spooky's "discovery" of FX3 and the license integration.
They openly admitted that they have looked at the product and will be honestly stealing some theme integration for upcoming titles.

This is the first time that Zen has ever featured another company in the scope of The Pinball Show, and this makes me pretty confidient to offer this prediction:

[quote, Jared Morgan, BlahCade Episode 231]
The next Spooky pinball table produced will debut both physically as a table release, and digitally on Pinball FX.

There will obviously be some sacrifices with digital effects not possible in physical tables, but expect the same layouts, with mechs inspired by digital effects.

Both Chris and I believe that Spooky may be partnering with Zen to get access to their licensing chops, so they don't get snubbed with licenses like they did with Stern getting Godzilla.

=== 1:03:00 - Jurassic Park Pin designed by Dead Flip

This redesigned layout screams of a late 80's pinball layout, and that is not a bad thing.
Stern needed a design refresh for The Pin machine, and Dead Flip got the nod to do it.

It makes me wonder if this is the start of Dead Flip getting his home brew table produced through Stern.
