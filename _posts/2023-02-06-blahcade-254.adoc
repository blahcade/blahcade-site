=== 25:45 - Founder Form and content transfer important information

For those that still need to take advantage of transferring owned titles from the Epic Games Store, use the https://forms.gle/VhYWMkES1euw3GJB9[Pinball FX Founders Form] to register your preferences.

The current deadline to fill out the founder's form is May 5. 
Zen confirmed in writing that purchases like The Addams Family or the Gearbox Pack will be eligible for the one-platform transfer.

As for content released *after* the initial console release (except for The Addams Family and Gearbox Pack), we have yet to receive an official statement about how those will be handled. 
We would _strongly recommend_ only making content purchases that come out after that initial launch day once more is revealed.

We will update you all once we learn more.

=== 36:00 - AtGame Legends Pinball

Chris gives a shoutout to a great YouTube video that gives constructive critique about the AtGames Legends Pinball table.

Check out the video because it is probably one of the best retrospectives we've seen about the AtGames pinball range. 

It made us go into some of our discussions about the pros and cons between A1UP and AtGames.
