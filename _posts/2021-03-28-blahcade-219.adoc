In Zen’s _The Pinball Show Ep. 3_ Mel Kirk sat down with Bobby and they talked more about Pinball FX, including some hard questions that they knew they’d need to tackle eventually.

The biggest news is that the Pinball FX platform is going to be an Epic Game Store exclusive for one year, and you will need to re-buy all your tables.

It’s worth breaking down some of the points that Mel raised and extrapolate upon them because you might have missed some of the contexts due to information overload.

== Show notes

This episode summary is a bit different from the other ones we typically put out.
You won’t see any real timing points here because if we added these in you might be tempted to jump to them and miss all the context before it.

Because we are breaking down quotes from an interview, you need to listen to the overall flow to get what we’re talking about.
So sit back, relax, and listen with an open mind and ear. 
If anything resonates with you let us know in either the YouTube comments or send us an email to the show.

Here’s the video of the episode if you want to respond on there:
