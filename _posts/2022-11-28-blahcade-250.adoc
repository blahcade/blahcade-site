In honor of the World Cup, we decided to look at an old Zen table that we hope will come to Pinball FX in the future: _Super League Football_.

NOTE: This episode is a YouTube only episode because it needs the video content to make sense.

There is a lot to like about Super League Football but the game times are too long. 

The game could actually exist in real life barring the upper playfield "cardboard cutouts".
Replace those with an array of drop targets and it would be about right.

Throughout the video we are constantly talking about how the game could be revised to make it faster to play but also more exciting and "risky". 

This game has seriously good bones and it needs to come back into _Pinball FX_ as soon as possible.
