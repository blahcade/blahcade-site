We have unlimited access to Mel Kirk from Zen Studios where we talk about the new Remastered mode in Williams Pinball and a pile of other stuff.

In this podcast, we have a huge chat with Mel Kirk from Zen Studios.
Nothing is really off-limits in the interview and we use that to our advantage to ask questions that have been burning a hole in our minds for years now.

There’s nothing more to say really, apart from getting on with the job of listening.
