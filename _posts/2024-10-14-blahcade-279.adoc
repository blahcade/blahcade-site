This go around Chris got his hands on Stern's Jurassic Park Home Edition at his local Costco and is here to address that price point. 

Also on the show we look at the WORST pinball machines from Bally, Data East, Gottlieb, Sega, Stern, and Williams. 

Let's see what debate that starts!

== Show notes

The show notes are the main reason why audio episodes are delayed. 
They take as long as the show takes to record to produce because to do it right (not with ChatGPT summaries) I have to listen back through the show and summarize them.

If you're missing the show notes and care enough about them, send this message to our BlahCade Twitter account or to blahblahblahcade@gmail.com:

`I missed the BlahCade show note summaries in Episode 279 and Jared told me to send this message.`

I'm doing a test to see how many people even read the notes from our show, and you sending this message is the only way I can truly work that out.
