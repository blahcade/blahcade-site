Chris explains why the Gottlieb packs for the AtGames Legends Pinball 4K might leave you wondering if FarSight even tried. 

Also, three tables were announced for Pinball FX, so we give our thoughts based on what is in the trailer before they release in May 2024.

== Show notes

The show notes are the main reason why audio episodes are delayed. 
They take as long as the show takes to record to produce because to do it right (not with ChatGPT summaries) I have to listen back through the show and summarize them.

If you're missing the show notes and care enough about them, send this message to our BlahCade Twitter account or to blahblahblahcade@gmail.com:

`I missed the BlahCade show note summaries in Episode 274 and Jared told me to send this message.`

I'm doing a test to see how many people even read the notes from our show, and you sending this message is the only way I can truly work that out.
