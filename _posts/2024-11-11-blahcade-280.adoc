Our annual discussion with Zen Studios COO Mel Kirk is here to talk all things pinball that happened in 2024 and a sneak peak at what to expect in 2025. 

It is fantastic to hear things from the source and fuel speculation of what will come. 

Thank you to all of those who sent questions in for Mel.

== Show notes

=== 0:00:00 - AtGames

See the snipped video for talking points from this video.

=== 0:20:50 - VR

* How is VR shaping up?

* Can you reveal in which quarter we might expect to see it?

* Is it going to be part of the core Pinball FX app or a separate app?

* Will it be Steam VR, MetaQuest native, PSVR, or other?

* Is support for peripheral controllers (for example, but not specifically, Gibson Pinball) planned for VR to give a more immersive experience?

* Can we expect a release model similar to ALP 4K where content releases roll out weekly or bi-weekly until all titles are available?

=== 0:23:50 - Mobile

News of the Pinball Mobile Beta starting up, but not much more at this stage.

=== 0:27:00 - Studio Update

* Where are we in terms of staffing at Zen? Back to expanding or maintaining the status quo?

* Is Zen in control of their own future now? Or at least not under threat as so many studios were a year ago?

* Are there genres beyond pinball, golf, and RPG youâ€™d like to see Zen expand into? Or is it about sticking to what you are good at and improving on that?

* FarSight is done, they let go their last person that had anything to do with Pinball Arcade. Do you have any insight into their Gottlieb agreement? If it is not a license Zen would pursue, is there any chance you would use your licensing know-how to help AtGames secure it as they did with Taito for Magic Pixel? 

* Current pinball designers seem to be taking cues from Zen about gameplay elements that a few years back would have seemed like impossibilities in the real world. Pure coincidence or does the studio feel they are being influential?

=== 0:34:40 - Pinball M

* How is Pinball M going a year after its release?

* Has the scope for what types of content fall under the Pinball M banner been expanded?

* Pinball M titles have come to ALP 4K with a parental restriction filter. Could the same be done to bring them within Pinball FX?

* Are there any IP that changed their minds about being part of this platform, or any that came knocking because of it?

* Are licensors happy with the ability to fully realize their adult themes?

* What has the general feedback been about the content released so far?

* Are there any IP that changed their minds about being part of this platform, or any that came knocking because of it?

* How has the scope for what types of content fall under the Pinball M banner been expanded?

* Will this continue to be a Zen Originals-only platform?

* Can you give us an update on the whole Pinball M to Pinball FX cross-buy blockers?

* Pinball M titles have come to ALP 4K with a parental restriction filter. Could the same be done to bring them within Pinball FX?

* Is there a stand-out title or pack that statistically reports as the most popular?

=== 0:47:00 - Pinball FX

* What happened to Pinball Royale?

* What are Zen's current views about multiplayer and what can be done with it?

* How many tables are planned out for 2025?

* How is the roadmap looking past this date, several years into the 10-year platform strategy?

* Are you looking to bring in other real-world pinball brands in the next year?

* Regardless of who Zen currently has a license with, what are your top 5 holy grail tables you'd like to see in Pinball FX at some point?

=== 0:55:15 - Zen Originals

* How do Zen originals play a role in the roadmap between the licensed properties?

* How important are originals to Zen's bottom line?

* Are there R&D differences between wholly original Zen titles and those with a license?

* Is there a stand-out title or pack (apart from Wild West and Sorcerers) that statistically reports as the most popular?

=== 1:00:45 - Licensing

* So is the situation that licensors are mostly seeking the studio out rather than the studio having to chase down potential partners?

* Is Aliens coming back?

* Does retiring the Balls of Glory table from FX3 amount to necessary steps to secure it for Pinball FX? 

* Are there some challenges with renewing the licenses (someone hypothesized Archer)? 

* Is there a stand-out title or pack that statistically reports as the most popular?

1:05:02 - Williams

* How many more tables do you think realistically remain for the Williams franchise?

* Have you had any luck with resolving the expertise issue with emulation changes?

* Is there an emulation era that is a cutoff point? (pre-1981, or no EMs, no Bally 6803 titles, etc)

* The backglass plays a prominent role in many titles, such as Banzai Run, NBA Fastbreak, Scared Stiff, Cyclone, and more. 
Does that factor in with deciding what titles Zen emulates?

* Is there a stand-out title or pack (apart from Fish Tales) that statistically reports as the most popular?

=== 1:12:47 - Final Thoughts

Closing thoughts from us all.
