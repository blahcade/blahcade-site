In this episode, we talk about Virtual Reality as it relates to pinball. The entire show focuses on every aspect that we could think of when you are considering playing commercial pinball games in VR.

We talk about hardware differences, gameplay differences, UI differences, and the overall “feeling” of bashing around a pinball in VR.

If you are a podcast listener, you may want to skip listening and jump right into watching this episode. 
We have included a lot of gameplay footage comparing FX2 PC to FX2 Quest 2 that might be interesting. 
We also have actual footage of Zaccaria Pinball VR and Stern Pinball Arcade VR pinball in action.

== Show notes

In this part, we go into what we are using to play VR and what the general experience is like between the physical hardware.

“Godrays” are those rays that shoot out from behind clouds. 
Also known as crepuscular rays or just sunbeams. 
In VR they are very distracting blurriness around high-contrast text and images. 
They are not good on Rift, but the Oculus 2 has not got any noticeable ones from what I can tell.

Chris tells us what it is like using a physical pinball controller in VR.

=== 26:00 — Why are we talking about VR now?

As a side note, Mel mentioned on a recent Arcade 1UP weekly show that VR is in the future for Zen Studios.

With that in mind, and because we now both have a way to play VR, we needed to get up to speed.

A big question among owners of FX3 is whether their tables purchases will transfer to the new platform, and what devices the game is even going to be released on.

Based on what Mel Kirk says, we speculate why the licensors probably want you to repurchase, even if Zen doesn’t.

Mel also confirmed that there will be a heap of new IPs in Pinball FX this year, including an additional Star Wars table announced in the next show.

News about physics as well. 😉

=== 29:30 - The UI and menus of Zen, Zacc, and Stern
