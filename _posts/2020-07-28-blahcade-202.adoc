In anticipation of California Extreme 2020, we go off on tangents.

Before the anticipated awesomeness of California Extreme 2020 happening on August 1st, 2020, Chris and I go off on tangents (hence the title) about all the stuff floating around since we last recorded.

This show format has a surprising ability to turn out great and you‚Äôll get a lot for your money in this episode.
Consider it a warm-up act for August 1st!

== Show notes

=== 04:30 ‚Äî Predictions for California Extreme
Chris and I try to guess what is going to be revealed at http://www.caextreme.org/[California Extreme 2020].

Most probably it will revolve around the Arcade 1UP tables and new table packs.
Stay tuned on August 1st for the full tamale.

=== 07:20 ‚Äî Safe Cracker massive score

I managed a rather large score on Safe Cracker and knocked off a talented player and friend of the show PinballWiz45b?
I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt be for long.

I share a few strategy tips about what worked for me in the game.
See if you can beat the score (85 others already have because that‚Äôs my leaderboard position) üòâ

=== 13:30 ‚Äî Reddit Pinball tournament

Chris gives us an update about the Reddit pinball tournament that uses Classic Arcade physics in Pinball FX3.
The tournament has been pretty competitive and there are some very good players playing each round.

Don‚Äôt let that put you off though: if you don‚Äôt like the hardcore physics, there‚Äôs another one running that uses Single Player (Zen) physics.

Visit https://www.reddit.com/r/PinballFX3/comments/eme27z/announcing_the_pinballfx3_reddit_pinball_league/[the Reddit league post] for more details.

=== 20:00 ‚Äî Chris has been watching Netflix

Because Chris is bored at the moment, he‚Äôs been gorging on Netflix series.
Check out the shows that Chris recommends in this segment.

=== 30:00 ‚Äî This Week In Pinball

If you aren‚Äôt already, do check out https://www.thisweekinpinball.com/[This Week In Pinball] for anything that‚Äôs worth knowing about real pinball news.

=== 32:00 ‚Äî American Pinball‚Äôs ‚ÄúOktoberfest‚Äù remote play

You can play Oktoberfest through a site called https://www.surrogate.tv/game/oktoberfest[Surrogate.tv].

I have tried to give it a go since recording the show and as predicted the latency is horrific from down here in Australia. 
Maybe in Finland ‚Äî where the machine is located ‚Äî it would be better.

=== 34:00 ‚Äî Games we‚Äôre playing

Chris and I have been playing a whole bunch of games and here are some of my highlights.

https://store.steampowered.com/app/377870/DARIUSBURST_Chronicle_Saviours/[DARIUSBURST on Steam]

This is a really great SHMUP if you love a challenging but achievable game.
The DLC available through the game also lets you purchase some retro SHMUPS like RayStorm which are worth checking out.

https://store.steampowered.com/app/610410/PAWARUMI/[PAWARUMI on Steam]

Pawarumi is a modern shoot'em up set in a retro futuristic sci-fi pre-Columbian universe.
This is an interesting SHMUP where you have three weapons that correspond to different colored enemies.

Match the color to charge your shield more. Match the opposite color spectrum to your enemy to inflict more damage and build your ‚Äúbomb‚Äù meter.
Incredible graphics using Unity and a great sound package.

https://store.steampowered.com/app/719930/Super_High_Ball/[Super High Ball on Steam]

Super High Ball is a unique blend between a Pinball and a Platformer game! 
An interesting take on the pinball mechanic in a twitch-style physics puzzler.

You know what you‚Äôre in for when you receive Steam achievements for dying lots. üòâ
You need an analog trigger controller because the flippers are not just on-off in nature. You have degrees of angle that are important in the game.
You‚Äôll die a lot.

=== 45:55 ‚Äî Arcade 1UP shenanigans

Chris goes into great detail about the games he‚Äôs installed on his mate‚Äôs Arcade 1UP cabinet.
There‚Äôs some great 80‚Äôs titles that we talk about in this section so check it out if you like your arcade games brutal and hungry.

=== 78:00 ‚Äî Button mashers

Chris did not install Track ‚Äôn‚Äô Field on his cabinet to preserve the buttons.
I then shared a Japanese game called Hyper Bishi Bashi Champ (I referred to it as ‚ÄúBishi Bashi Special‚Äù which in fact was the PS1 release).

https://www.highwaygames.com/arcade-machines/hyper-bishi-bashi-champ-arcade-machine-8129/[Hyper Bishi Bashi Champ Arcade Machine]

Hyper Bishi Bashi Champ is a multi-player, mini-game arcade machine from Konami that contains 27 mini-games!

BISH BASH!! üòÄ
