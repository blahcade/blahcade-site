This is a special walkthrough episode where Chris and I play the Zen Pinball Party app on Apple Arcade.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zen-pinball-party/id1536783591 is the app listing.

If you want to get in on the action for free, check out the deal through https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/18/apple-teams-up-with-target-free-music-tv-arcade-icloud-storage/[Target Circle] for six-months free Apple Arcade. 
Chris has got on this deal and can confirm it is legit.

This particular episode was not converted into a podcast because there was really no point.
You need to head over to the video in the <<watch-and-listen>> section and check out the gameplay.
